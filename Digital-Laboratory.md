## Introduction

The 74HC ICs will tolerate a power supply between 2 V and 6 V however 3.3 V and 5 V are common choices for real circuits today. We will use 5 V through this laboratory. The laboratory power supplies are variable up to 30 V. We will use a linear 3‐terminal regulator, the 7805, which will produce 5 V output for an input of approximately 7 V or higher (it has a “dropout” voltage of 1.7 V as specified in the [datasheet](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/LM7805.pdf)).
